#Original script created on October 20, 2013
#started updating for Citrix Cloud on August 28, 2020

# This script is based on the CVAD V3.00 doc script

#Version 1.12 30-Jan-2021
#	Fixed duplicate item in the HTML output for Machine Catalogs

#Version 1.11 25-Jan-2021
#	Added error checking in Function Check-NeededPSSnapins (Requested by Guy Leech)
#	Updated the error message when Get-XDAuthentication fails
#	Updated the error messages in Function ProcessScriptSetup
#	Updated the help text
#	Updated the ReadMe file

#Version 1.10 5-Dec-2020
#	Added CustomerID to function ShowScriptInfo and ProcessScriptEnd
#	Added the missing ReadMe file link to the warning message about the missing Citrix.GroupPolicy.Commands file
#	Added to Hosting Connection section:
#	(Thanks to fellow CTPs Neil Spellings, Kees Baggerman, and Trond Eirik Haavarstein for getting this info for me)
#		Amazon EC2    
#		Google Cloud Platform
#		Microsoft Azure
#		Nutanix AHV
#		Remote PC Wake on LAN
#	Added variables, counters, and text for the following Administrative Roles
#		Cloud Administrator: [int]$Script:TotalCloudAdmins
#		Full Monitor Administrator: [int]$Script:TotalFullMonitorAdmins
#		Probe Agent Administrator: [int]$Script:TotalProbeAdmins
#		Session Administrator: [int]$Script:TotalSessionAdmins
#	Correct the invalid variable name in the ScriptInfo output file for WordFilename
#	Fixed alignment in the Text output for the ScriptInfo output file
#	Fixed bug reported by David Prows in the Hosting section. First, check to see if the hosting connection's 
#		AdditionalStorage.StorageLocations is valid
#	For all calls to Get-AdminAdministrator, remove the -SortBy Name. Sorting by Name is the default behavior.
#	For MCS Machine Catalogs:
#		Check that the catalog's ProvisioningSchemeId is not $Null before retrieving the Provision Scheme's machine data
#		Check that $MachineData is not $Null before checking for HostingUnitName
#	For the Hosting section, for High Availability Servers and Power Actions, handle empty arrays
#	In Function GetAdmins, for Hosting Connections, handle the error "The property 'ScopeId' cannot be found on this object. Verify that the property exists."
#		Also, added some white space to make the function easier for me to read
#	In Function OutputAdminsForDetails, add "No Admins found" to replace blank tables and text output
#	In Function OutputDeliveryGroupCatalogs, handle the case where a Delivery Group has no Machine Catalog(s) assigned
#	In Function OutputMachineDetails, when using Test-NetConnection, add Resolve-DnsName first to see if the machine name is resolvable. 
#		This prevents every call to Test-NetConnection from failing with "<MachineName> was not found in DNS". Add error message:
#		<MachineName> was not found in DNS. VDA Registry Key data cannot be gathered.
#		Otherwise, every machine was reported as offline, which may not be true.
#	In Function OutputPerZoneView, add "There are no zone members for Zone <ZoneName>" to replace blank tables and text output
#	In Function OutputSummaryPage, add text for Cloud, Full Monitor, Probe Agent, and Session Administrators
#	KNOWN ISSUE: 
#		A few users report they get the following errors even in a new elevated PowerShell session:
#			"Import-Module : A drive with the name 'XDHyp' already exists."
#			"ProcessScriptSetup : Unable to import the Citrix.Host.Commands module. Script cannot continue."
#		Even if the script runs for these users, the Hosting section contains no usable data.
#			Hosting
#				Unable to retrieve Hosting Units
#			
#				Unable to retrieve Hosting Connections
#			 
#			My-Hosting-ConnectioName
#				Connection Name		My-Hosting-ConnectioName
#				Type				Hypervisor Type could not be determined:
#				Address	   
#				State				Disabled
#				Username	   
#				Scopes	   
#				Maintenance Mode	Off
#				Zone	   
#				Storage resource name	   
#
#			Advanced
#				Connection Name		My-Hosting-ConnectioName
#				Unable to retrieve Hosting Connections
#		I have been unable to determine the root cause, a resolution, or a workaround for this issue
#	Provide full details in the error message if the Citrix.Common.GroupPolicy snapin is missing (Thanks to Guy Leech for the suggestion)
#	Removed all references to $Script:CCParams1 and @CCParams1
#	Removed all references to AdminAddress
#	Removed Controllers from the ScriptInfo output file and the Section parameter switch statement
#	Removed Licensing from the Summary Page because there are no individual license files in Citrix Cloud
#	Reordered the parameters in an order recommended by Guy Leech
#	Updated the ReadMe file

#Version 1.00 21-Sep-2020
#
#	Add a switch statement for the machine/desktop/server Power State
#	Add a test to make sure the script is running from an elevated PowerShell session
#	Add additional Citrix Cloud administrator permissions:
#		App-V
#			Add App-V applications
#			Remove App-V applications
#		Cloud
#			Read Storefront Configuration 
#			Update Storefront Configuration
#		Director
#			View Filters page Application Instances only
#			View Filters page Connections only
#			View Filters page Machines only
#			View Filters page Sessions only
#		Other Permissions

#	Added a -ProfileName parameter for use by Get-XDAuthentication 
#		For more information, see the Authentication section in the ReadMe file https://carlwebster.sharefile.com/d-sb4e144f9ecc48e7b
#		Thanks to David Prows and Devan Tilly for documenting this process for me to use
#	Added testing to see if the computer running the script is in a Domain or Workgroup
#		If not in a domain, and VDARegistryKeys is set, set it to $False
#		If not in a domain, set NoADPolicies to $True
#	Added testing to see if the Remote SDK is installed (Thanks to Martin Zugec)
#	Change all Write-Verbose $(Get-Date) to add -Format G to put the dates in the user's locale (Thanks to Guy Leech)
#	Change checking some String variables from just $Null to [String]::IsNullOrEmpty
#		Some cmdlet's string properties are sometimes Null and sometimes an empty string
#	Change checking the way a machine is online or offline
#	Change some cmdlets to sort on the left of the pipeline using the cmdlet's -SortBy option
#	Changed testing for existing PSDrives from Get-PSDrive to Test-Path
#	Comment out the code for Session Recording until Citrix enables the cmdlet in the Cloud
#	Fixed administrators output by restricting to UserIdentityType -ne "Sid" -and (-not ([String]::IsNullOrEmpty($_.Name)))
#	Fixed an issue with "Connections meeting any of the following (Access Gateway) filters"
#		If you selected HTML and any other output format in the same run, only the HTML output had any Access Gateway data
#	Fixed issue with PowerShell 5.1.x and empty Hashtables for Ian Brighton's Word Table functions
#		PoSH 3, 4, and 5.0 had no problem with an empty hashtable and would create a blank Word table with only column headings
#		For many tables, before passing the hashtable to Ian's function, test if the hashtable is empty
#		If it is, create a dummy row of data for the hashtable
#		For example, a RemotePC catalog based on OU that contains no machines, or Applications with no administrators
#		Instead of having a missing table, the table will now have a row that says "None found"
#	Fixed issue with the array used for Appendix A and the CSV file when selecting multiple output formats
#		If HTML and Text and MSWord were selected, Appendix A and the CSV file contained three duplicate entries
#		Changed from using only one array to three. Changed from using $Script:ALLVDARegistryItems to
#			$Script:WordALLVDARegistryItems
#			$Script:TextALLVDARegistryItems
#			$Script:HTMLALLVDARegistryItems
#	Fixed output issues with Power Management settings
#	Fixed several more array out of bounds issues when accessing element 0 when the array was empty
#	Fixed Zone output by excluding "Initial Zone" and Zones with a name of "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
#	For Appendix A, Text output, change the column heading "DDC Name" to "Computer Name" to match the HTML and MSWord/PDF output
#	For Zones, add Citrix Cloud Connectors
#	For Zones, add MemType into the Sort-Object for Site View and Zone View
#	For Zones, for MSWord and PDF output, change the column widths
#	Removed a lot of the Licensing code as there are no Get-Lic* cmdlets in the Remote SDK
#	Removed all code for BrokerRegistryKeys
#		Removed AppendixB
#	Removed all code for CEIP
#	Removed all code for Hardware
#	Removed all code for Microsoft hotfixes, Citrix hotfixes, and installed Windows Features and Roles
#		Removed AppendixC, AppendixD, and AppendixE
#	Removed all code for the Controllers section
#		Also removed code for checking if StoreFront is installed on the Delivery Controller
#	Removed all code for the three Citrix SQL databases
#	Removed some code for Configuration Logging
#		We don't have access to Preferences or the Logging database details
#		We do have access to the configuration logging high-level action details
#		Remove checking for product code MPS since that doesn't exist in the cloud licenses
#	Removed the help text and parameter for $AdminAddress
#		Hardcode $AdminAddress to LocalHost
#	Removed licensing data that didn't make sense for Citrix Cloud and added some data that did make sense
#	Since the RegistrationState property is an enum, add .ToString() to the machine/desktop/server variable so HTML output is correct
#	When getting the Master VM for an MCS based machine catalog, also check for images ending in .template for Nutanix
#	When getting the provisioning scheme data for a machine, only process machines with a provisioning type of MCS
#		There is no provisioning scheme data for manually or PVS provisioned machines
#	When VDARegistryKeys is used, now test the RemoteRegistry service for its status
#		If the service is not running, add that information into the various *VDARegistryItems arrays
#	Where appropriate, changed all "CVAD" to "CC"
